- Binary operator parsing:
  - Assignment operator should bind lower than everything else; currently, `*a = b` is parsed as `*(a = b)`.
  - Introduce operator precedence or apply operators from left to right.
- Not all escaped characters inside string or character literals are escaped correctly.
- The multiplication operator does not handle overflow correctly when multiplying `char`s
- Documentation and code quality
